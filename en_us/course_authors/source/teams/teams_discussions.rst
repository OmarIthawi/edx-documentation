Managing Team Discussions 
#########################


As in course discussions, different roles have different privileges in team
discussions.

.. note:: The members of the course team that you set up in Studio or on the
   Instructor Dashboard in the LMS are not automatically granted discussion
   administration roles.

   Discussion administration roles must be explicitly granted to members of the
   course team for them to be able to moderate or administer course discussions.
   The course author and any team members who have the Admin role can grant
   discussion administration roles.

For information about discussion administration roles, see
:ref:`Assigning_discussion_roles`. For information about managing discussions,
see :ref:`Running_discussions`.
