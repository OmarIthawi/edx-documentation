*******************************
Teams Overview
*******************************

Using teams in your course enables learners to interact and collaborate in
small groups around topics that you create.

Learners can create their own teams and use not only names and descriptions to
identify them but also, optionally, a primary communication language and a
primary country that members identify with. Team characteristics might serve
as the basis for attracting new members, resulting in small groups of learners
with similar interests and goals who will work together on projects within the
same topic area.

*******************************
Enabling and Configuring Teams
*******************************

To enable teams in your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, from the **Settings** menu, select **Advanced Settings**.

#. On the **Advanced Settings** page, locate the **Teams Configuration** policy key.

#. Within this policy key you define two entries, topics and maximum team size.

#. To specify the maximum team size for teams in your course, enter the
   ``max_team_size`` parameter in double quotation marks, a colon, then the
   value. For example, to set the maximum number of learners per team in your
   course to 5, your entry would be:

   ``"max_team_size": 5``

#. To specify topics within which teams can be created, add entries under
   ``"topics"``. For each topic, provide a description, name, and ID as shown in the example.

   .. note:: In topic specifications, you can use only alphanumeric characters
      and these special characters: underscore, hyphen, and period.

.. is this note re special characters true?

   {
    "topics": [
        {
            "name": "Sustainability in Corporations",
            "description": "Description for Sustainability in Corporations",
            "id": "Sustain_Corporations"
        },
        {
            "name": "Water Conservation Projects",
            "description": "Description for Water Conservation",
            "id": "Water_Conservation"
        },
        {
            "name": "Sustainability Standards and Reporting",
            "description": "Description for Sustainability Standards",
            "id": "Standards_Reporting"
        }
    ],
    "max_team_size": 5
   }


.. note:: If you create more than one topic, make sure there is a comma after
   the closing curly brace of each topic that has another topic following it.

   Make sure all of the sets of topic values are enclosed within a set of square
   brackets, with a comma after the closing square bracket.

The topics you have created are shown in the LMS when learners browse teams by
topic.
