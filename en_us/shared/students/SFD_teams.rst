Teamwork in Courses
##########################################

Some courses support small teams, organized around topics, that you can join to study or work on a project together. If your course course includes teams, your instructor or course staff will provide guidelines for how you should work in teams.

About Teams and Topics
************************

If teams are used in your course, there is a **Teams** page in the LMS where
you can see the topics that have been created by the course team. Teams are
created within a specific topic, and have a maximum team size.

If it up to you to browse the topics and find one that you are interested in
working on. Then, you join a team that is working on that topic. For more
information, see :ref:`Finding a Team to Join`.


======================================
Browse Topics and Find a Team to Join
======================================

To browse topics and find a team to join, follow these steps.

#. In the LMS, select the **Teams** page.
#. Select the **Browse** tab.
#. On the **Browse** page, read about each of the available topics to work in.

#. When you have found a topic you are interested in, select the arrow button
   to see the teams that exist in that topic.

   language of a team and a country that team members identify with, are
   shown.

#. To get a better sense of a team's members, discussion, and communications,
   select **View** for a team.

   you cannot participate unless you are a member of the team.

Inviting Friends to Join Your Team

invitations if the team has not reached its maximum number of members.

#. On your team's details page, select and copy the URL under **Invite Others**.
