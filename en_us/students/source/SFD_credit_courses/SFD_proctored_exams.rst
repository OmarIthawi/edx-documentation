Proctored Exams
#########################

Proctored exams are exams that use both time limits and online proctoring
software. To pass a proctored exam, you must receive both a passing grade for
the exam itself and a Pass result when the recording of your proctoring
session is reviewed.

Before you begin a proctored exam, you must specify whether you want to take
the exam as a proctored exam. If you take the exam as a proctored exam, you
receive instructions to install the proctoring software, verify your identity,
and scan the desk and room where you are taking the exam.

If you do not take the exam as a proctored exam, the exam is still timed.
However, you are no longer eligible for credit for the course.
